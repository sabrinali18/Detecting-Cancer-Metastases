# Detecting Cancer Metastases on Gigapixel Pathology Images

Contributors: Zizhao Wang & Sabrina Li


### Objective
The goal of this project is to detect and classify breast cancer metastases in whole-slide images of histological lymph node sections. Given a collection of training dataset provided by [CAMELYON16 challenge](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/Data/), we developed a multi-scale model that outputs a heatmap showing regions of a biopsy image likely to contain cancer.
